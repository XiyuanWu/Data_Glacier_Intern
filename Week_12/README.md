# Week 12 - Model Selection and Building

Presentation mode [here](https://gamma.app/docs/Bank-Marketing-Analysis-l6jsybim7mqyq2o).

Select your base model and then explore 1 model of each family if it's a classification problem, then 1 model for Linear models, 1- Model for Ensemble, 1-Model for boosting, and other models if you have time (like stacking)
 
Please make sure the selected model fits your business requirements. For example, if your business does not want a black box model, choose only those dethatches that can be used to explain the prediction.

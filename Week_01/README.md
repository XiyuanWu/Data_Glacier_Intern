# Week 1 - Version Control

- Clone the VC repo (https://github.com/DataGlacier/VC.git)
- Create a new branch
- checkout newly created branch
- Run the add.py and provide your name and fav sport as input
- Run the test script using the below command:      
- pytest test/test.py -s
- ignore the warning and if there is no error then add,commit and push your changes to repo
- create pull request and assign to reviewer (if you are working in the group else push the changes to your own repo and submit the URL of that)
- If reviewer approves then merge the changes to master (optional as this is individual assignment.)
